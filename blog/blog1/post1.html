            <p class="bg-white outline">
                When it comes to fried seafood the city of New Orleans has many
                greats, but the king of fried catfish is Barrow's.

            <p class="bg-green">
                The first word that comes ot my head when thinking of the food at Barrow's is exceptional.
                They have taking a classic fried food dish and have not done anything fancy to it, but
                rather they have perfected it. They way that they prepare their catfiah is with a classic 
                breading and lightly seasoned. The cruch on the batter and the light flaky meat of the fish 
                make my mouth water just htinking of it. Potatoe salad is served along side the catfish, and 
                the creamy potatoe salad nicely offsets the chrispy bites of catfish. Although I do not know
                why one would want to stray away from the catfish Barrows does have other options. They also have 
                fried osyters and shrimp with a varity of sides and starters. I have never vertured away from the 
                catfish, but I have no doubt that all the other items on the menu are outstanding.

            <p class="bg-blue">
                The service at Barrow's is second to none. Upon walking in you are greated by a 
                highly hospitable host that will seat you at a table. The host when I visited was the nicest
                man that I have ever meet. He would periodidocally check on us to make sure we were well taking care of.
                The waitress that took care of me wass also very great; she was alwaalwas checking in to make sure
                that we had everything that we needed and that the food was perfect.
