      <p>
        The first word that comes to my head when thinking of the food at
        Barrow's is exceptional. They have taken a classic fried food dish and
        not done anything fancy to it, but rather they have perfected it. The
        way that they prepare their catfiah is with a classic breading and a
        light seasoning. The cruch on the batter along with the light flaky meat
        of the fish make my mouth water just thinking of it. Along side the
        catfish is a fresh scoop of potato salad, and the creamy potato salad
        nicely offsets the crispy bites of catfish. Although I do not know why
        one would want to stray away from the catfish, Barrows does have other
        options to choose from. They also have fried osyters and shrimp with a
        varity of other sides and starters. I have never vertured away from the
        catfish, but I have no doubt that all the other items on the menu are
        outstanding.

      <h3 class="text-blue" id="section-service">Service</h3>
      <p>
        The service at Barrow's is second to none. Upon walking in you are
        greated by a highly hospitable host that will seat you at a table. The
        host when I visited was the nicest man that I have ever met. He would
        periodically check on us to make sure we were well taking care of. The
        waitress that took care of us was also very great; she was always
        checking in to make sure that we had everything that we needed and that
        the food was perfect. Even the head chef came out to make sure all the
        food was perfect.
