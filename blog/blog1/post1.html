        When it comes to fried seafood the city of New Orleans has many greats,

      <h3 class="text-blue" id="section-food">Food</h3>
      <p>
        The first word that comes to my head when thinking of the food at
        Barrow's is exceptional. They have taken a classic fried food dish and
        have not done anything fancy to it, but rather they have perfected it.
        The way that they prepare their catfiah is with a classic breading and
        lightly seasoned. The cruch on the batter and the light flaky meat of
        the fish make my mouth water just htinking of it. Potato salad is served
        along side the catfish, and the creamy potato salad nicely offsets the
        crispy bites of catfish. Although I do not know why one would want to
        stray away from the catfish, Barrows does have other options. They also
        have fried osyters and shrimp with a varity of other sides and starters.
        I have never vertured away from the catfish, but I have no doubt that
        all the other items on the menu are outstanding.

      <h3 class="text-blue" id="section-service">Service</h3>
      <p>
        The service at Barrow's is second to none. Upon walking in you are
        greated by a highly hospitable host that will seat you at a table. The
        host when I visited was the nicest man that I have ever meet. He would
        periodically check on us to make sure we were well taking care of. The
        waitress that took care of us was also very great; she was always
        checking in to make sure that we had everything that we needed and that
        the food was perfect. Even the head chef came out to make sure all the
        food was perfect.

        very easy to access and is conveintly located in Mid-City, so it it a
