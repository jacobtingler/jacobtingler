            <p>
                The first word that comes to my head when thinking of the food at Barrow's is exceptional.
                They have taken a classic fried food dish and have not done anything fancy to it, but
                rather they have perfected it. The way that they prepare their catfiah is with a classic 
                breading and lightly seasoned. The cruch on the batter and the light flaky meat of the fish 
                make my mouth water just htinking of it. Potato salad is served along side the catfish, and 
                the creamy potato salad nicely offsets the crispy bites of catfish. Although I do not know
                why one would want to stray away from the catfish, Barrows does have other options. They also have 
                fried osyters and shrimp with a varity of other sides and starters. I have never vertured away from the 
                catfish, but I have no doubt that all the other items on the menu are outstanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The service at Barrow's is second to none. Upon walking in you are greated by a 
                highly hospitable host that will seat you at a table. The host when I visited was the nicest
                man that I have ever meet. He would periodically check on us to make sure we were well taking care of.
                The waitress that took care of us was also very great; she was always checking in to make sure
                that we had everything that we needed and that the food was perfect. Even the head chef came out to make
                sure all the food was perfect.

            <p> 
                Barrow's is located at 8300 Earhart Blvd. Suite 103. The location is very easy to access and is 
                conveintly located in Mid-City, so it it a central location. Parking is not an issue because of the large lot
                that is in front of the building.
