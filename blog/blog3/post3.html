        <p>
          This blog will explain the main functions of the hangman game that I
          have posted under the projects section of my website. It was created
          using vanilla javascript and bootstrap. The HTML is very simple and is
          a div that contains the hangman pictures, the word to guess, and the
          buttons used to guess the word. All of the other implementaion is
          through javascript. In this post I will explain some of the main
          functions that are used.

        <h3>Handling A Guess</h3>
        <p>
          The most important part of the hangman game is handling the guesses,
          and this is done when a button from the on screen keyboard is pressed.
          Once a button is pressed it calls the function guess() and that
          function does most of the work for the program. First the function
          adds the letter that was pressed into the guessed array to store all
          the letters that have previously been guessed. Then it disables the
          button so that the same letter cannot be guessed twice. Then it checks
          if the guessed letter was in the answer or not, and if the letter was
          then it calls two helper functions. The first puts the letter that was
          guessed into an array in the correct spot for the answer and displays
          the letters in the correct postion. The second helper method checks to
          see if the user has correctly guessed the word. If the guessed letter
          was not in the word then the function calls three helper methods. The
          first updates the number of mistakes that have been made and displays
          the number for the user to see. The second checks if the user has
          reached the maximum number of wrong guesses and has lost the game. The
          final helper method updates the picture for the game.
        </p>

          <img class="" src="./images/guess.png" />
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h3>Updating The Word</h3>
        <p>
          This function is responsible for displaying the letter that was
          guessed. First it splits the answer into an array. Then it maps the
          guessed letter to the correct postion to display to the user. Finally
          it Updates the the displayed word by getting the id from the HTML
          document. This function heavily relies upon array functions, and they
          can be tricky, but with a good understanding of them it makes this
          task simple.

          <img src="./images/checkword.png" />
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h3>Saving the Scores</h3>
        <p>
          This section of the script is responsible for saving the users scores
          to local storage. I created an object called score that will hold the
          name of the user and the score that they recieved. The object is then
          pushed to the highScores[] array and is sorted from lowest number of
          guesses to the highest number of guesses. Finally I pushed the object
          into local storage by stringifying the highScores array. The code
          below the function will not allow a score to be saved unless a
          username is entered into the input box.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="./images/saveScore.png" />
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This is a great project for people that are starting to learn
          javascript. It uses some important array functions that will make you
          understand them fully. Also, it uses the local storage of the browser,
          and that is also a great thing ot learn for you to further your
          programming development.

        I am a native New Olreanian, and I currently go to University of New
        Orleans. I have created this blog to share how to make your very own
        hangman game. I hope that it works as a good guide for you, and that you
        are able to implement it into your own website!
